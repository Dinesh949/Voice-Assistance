# Python Voice Assistant
This is a simple Python application that can perform various tasks through voice commands. 
It is built using the following libraries:

1. SpeechRecognition
2. pyttsx3
3. pywhatkit
4. datetime
5. wikipedia
6. pyjokes
7. requests

# Installation
-- To install the dependencies, use pip:
>> pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pywhatkit wikipedia requests

This application uses the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for voice recognition. To use this API, you need to have a Google Cloud Platform account and
create a project with the Speech-to-Text API enabled. You also need to set up authentication to access the API. Follow the instructions in this guide 
[chick here](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/transcribe-client-libraries) to set up the API and authentication.

# Usage
-- To use the application, simply run the voice_assistant.py file:
>> Voice Assistance APP.py

The application will start listening for voice commands. You can say things like:

* "Alexa, play some music"
* "Alexa, what time is it?"
* "Alexa, who is Barack Obama?"
* "Alexa, tell me a joke"
* "Alexa, what's the weather like in New York?"

To stop the application, say "Alexa, stop".
